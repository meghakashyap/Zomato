	Will India's stock markets accept a loss-making company going public, and learn to value tech companies like private investors do? This question was emphatically answered with 13-year-old food tech start-up Zomato's blockbuster IPO last mont
	With the introduction of .xxx domains in 2011, Zomato also launched zomato.xxx, a site dedicated to food porn.[25] In May 2012, it launched a print version of the website named "Citibank Zomato Restaurant Guide," in collaboration with Citibank, but it has since been discontinued.[26]

Zomato had also made a name for itself for its prowess in digital marketing.[27]

In February 2017, Zomato announced plans to launch Zomato Infrastructure services, a service to help restaurants expand their presence without incurring any fixed costs.[28][29] In September 2017, Zomato claimed the company had "turned profitable" in all 24 countries where it operated and introduced a "zero-commission model" for partner restaurants.[30] Towards the end of 2017, Zomato stopped accepting updates from its active users by not utilizing moderators to verify and make updates. Users of the app reported issues with new features to pay for orders.[citation needed]

Zomato narrowed down its losses by 34% to ₹389 crore[clarification needed] for the financial year 2016–17, from ₹590.1 crore[clarification needed] in the previous year 2015–16.[31][32]

In September 2019, Zomato fired almost 10% of its workforce (540 people) tending to back-end activities like customer service, merchant and delivery partner support functions.[33] In April 2020, due to rising demand for online groceries amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Zomato launched its grocery delivery services named Zomato Market in 80+ cities across India.
